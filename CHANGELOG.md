# Changelog

All notable changes to **rush** are documented here. The format is loosely based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project predates a
tagged release, so everything lives under a single development heading.

## [Unreleased] — 0.1.0 (2026-06-16)

The shell grew from a foundation (REPL, pipelines, redirection, three builtins)
into a near-complete POSIX-style shell. Work is grouped by area below; see the
git history for the commit-by-commit narrative.

### Expansion
- **Variables** — `$VAR`, `${VAR}`; shell variables shadow the environment.
- **`${…}` operators** — `:-`/`-`, `:=`/`=`, `:+`/`+`, `:?`/`?`, and `${#name}`
  (length); the default/alternate word is itself expanded.
- **Special parameters** — `$?` (last exit status), `$0`–`$9`, `${10}`, `$#`,
  `$*`, and `$@` (with a standalone `"$@"` keeping each parameter separate).
- **Tilde** — `~` / `~/path` → `$HOME` (falls back to `$USERPROFILE`).
- **Command substitution** — `$(...)`, supporting operators and compounds inside.
- **Arithmetic** — `$((expr))`: `+ - * / %`, comparisons, `&& || !`, parentheses,
  and variables; `$`-references are expanded first (`$(( $1 + $2 ))`).
- **Globbing** — a hand-rolled matcher: `*`, `?`, `[…]` with ranges and `[!…]`,
  multi-component patterns (`src/*.rs`), and the POSIX leading-dot rule.
- **Word-splitting** — unquoted expansions split on whitespace; quotes suppress it.

### Grammar & control flow
- Recursive-descent parser producing a nestable AST.
- **Operators** — `&&`, `||`, `;`, and `&` (background), with exit-status
  short-circuiting.
- **Control flow** — `if`/`elif`/`else`/`fi`, `while`/`until`/`do`/`done`,
  `for … in … do … done`, `case … esac`, and `break`/`continue [n]`.
- **Functions** — `name() { … }` with recursion, own positional parameters, and
  `return [n]`; brace groups `{ …; }`.
- **Subshells** — `( … )` isolating the working directory and variables.
- **Comments** — `#` to end of line.
- **Multi-line input** — a `> ` continuation prompt; unfinished quotes, `$(`,
  `${`, and here-docs all keep reading.

### Redirection & I/O
- File redirection per fd: `<`, `>`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>>`.
- **fd duplication** — `2>&1` / `n>&m` (`> f 2>&1` sends both to one file).
- **Both streams** — `&>` / `&>>`.
- **Here-documents** — `<<EOF`, `<<-EOF` (tab-strip), `<<'EOF'` (no expansion).

### Builtins
- `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `export`, `unset`, `test` / `[ ]`, `true`, `false`, `:`,
  `break`, `continue`, `return`, `exit`.
- Unix job control: `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `kill [-SIG] %job|pid`.

### Job control (Unix)
- Background jobs (`&`), process groups, terminal hand-off (`tcsetpgrp`), and
  signal handling following the glibc reference.
- Ctrl-Z stop detection, `fg`/`bg` resume, and a job table reaped at each prompt.
- Gated behind `#[cfg(unix)]` (uses `libc`); other platforms run foreground-only.

### Execution modes
- Interactive REPL with line editing and persistent history (`~/.rush_history`).
- Script files: `rush script.sh args…` (sets `$0`, `$1`…).
- Command strings: `rush -c "cmds" [name args…]`.

### Tooling & docs
- GitHub Actions CI: build + test on Linux and Windows, plus clippy on Linux.
- `.gitattributes` normalizing line endings to LF.
- README feature matrix and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` kept current throughout.

### Notes & known limitations
- Compound commands can't yet be placed as one stage among several in a
  multi-command pipeline (e.g. `(cmd) | grep x`) — only a pipeline that is a
  single compound is supported today.

## [Unreleased] — since 0.1.1

### Packaging & release (G1–G4)
- MIT `LICENSE` and `license`/`description`/`repository` `Cargo.toml` metadata.
- Tagged releases build a Windows zip artifact (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
- README status block: explicit "experimental" status, Windows foreground-only
  limitation stated in plain terms.
- `cd -` returns to (and prints) `$OLDPWD`, tracked on every successful `cd`.

### Real fd semantics (G10)
- `2>&1` combined with a pipe or command substitution now genuinely routes
  stderr through: `cmd 2>&1 | next` and `x=$(cmd 2>&1)` both capture the merged
  stream correctly. Fixed by materializing a real OS pipe by hand (Unix only)
  when a `Dup` redirect targets a sink `Stdio::piped()` can't share before
  spawn — see `exec.rs`'s `make_pipe`/`clone_or_materialize`.
- Subshells (`(...)`) now fork a real child on Unix instead of approximating
  isolation via state save/restore: `(cd x; …)`, `(VAR=…; …)`, and `exit`
  inside `(…)` are genuinely isolated and can't leak back to the parent shell.
  The old snapshot/restore approximation remains as the non-Unix fallback
  (still can't contain an `exit`).

### Builtin redirects (found during the G10 review)
- Redirects on a builtin (`echo hi > f`, `pwd 2>e`, `cd < f`, …) used to be
  silently ignored — builtins write via `println!`/`eprintln!` straight to
  the process's real stdio, bypassing the shell's fd resolution entirely.
  Fixed on Unix: the shell's own fd 0/1/2 are temporarily `dup2`'d to match
  before running the builtin, then restored (even if a redirect fails partway
  through). Off Unix, this remains a known limitation (no raw `dup2`
  equivalent). Only covers a builtin as the sole command of a pipeline; one in
  the middle of a multi-stage pipe (`echo hi | cd`) is unaffected — still the
  pre-existing punt (rush tries to exec it as an external program).

### Tab completion (G5)
- A custom rustyline `Helper` (`completion.rs`) replaces `DefaultEditor`. In
  command position (a rough, not lexer-accurate check — see the module doc),
  Tab completes builtin names and executables found scanning `$PATH`;
  elsewhere it defers to rustyline's own `FilenameCompleter` for files.
